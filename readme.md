#### Learning new React from scratch with Brian Holt course on Frontend Masters.

## Intro
- two scripts in the index file (react and react-dom), makes them behave as a global variable. 
- React is an API part of a library, and react-dom is actual renderer on a DOM.
- App function needs to be called. That's why we add renderer in script tags.
- JSX is translated into the JS. Then React.createElement is called.
- Components always has to return markup, the result of React.createElement.
